    üéØ Task:
    Select multiple [x, y] keypoints in the **egocentric image** that are critical for performing the action '{action}' on the '{object_name}'.

    - Identify functionally important parts (e.g., contact or force areas)

    - If there are multiple '{object_name}' instances, mark keypoints on **each of them**
    - Place **at least 3 well-separated** points covering the entire functional region
