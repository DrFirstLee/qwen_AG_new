        Describe precise regions (in words) that are essential for performing '{action}' on the '{object_name}'.

        üîç Guidelines:
        - Focus on human-interaction or force-application areas (e.g., handles, grips, pedals, joints, switches, edges used to push/pull).
        - Cover the entire functional region (e.g., both ends and the center of a handle).
        - If multiple '{object_name}' instances are present, describe keypoints on each instance.
        - Be concrete and spatially specific (e.g., "center of the handle", "left hinge", "front-right edge").
        - Start each sentence with the part/region name and, if helpful, mention how it supports '{action}'.
        - Do NOT mention pixel coordinates, sizes, bounding boxes, labels, or add explanations beyond the sentences.

    Select multiple [x, y] keypoints in the **egocentric image** that are critical for performing the action '{action}' on the '{object_name}'.

    üîç Use the exocentric image to:
    - Understand typical interaction patterns
    - Identify functionally important parts (e.g., contact or force areas)

    üìå Guidelines:
    - Keypoints must lie **within** the '{object_name}' in the egocentric image
    - If there are multiple '{object_name}' instances, mark keypoints on **each of them**
    - Place **at least 3 well-separated** points covering the entire functional region
